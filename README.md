The Abifestival App is a cross-platform Titanium app made for the music-festival "Abifestival" organized 
by high-school graduates in Germany. The app was initially build in 2012 as a classic Titanium project
and has recently been rewritten to Alloy. It is open source to share the concepts behind making a Titanium 
application and it includes native features like remote push-notifications with PushWoosh and a 
completely native user-experience.
